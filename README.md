### Hi, I'm me

I'm Sam, pro figure-outer and tinkerer. I like rethinking and innovating. I was born on a computer and am a nerd.

#### Currently
- Working on a Counter-Strike 2 custom server browser
- Learning more about minds, memory, and cognition
- Writing about software and thinking on my [blog](https://trouy.dev/blog)

#### Previously
- Worked on founding my own startup around agentic AI
- Founding engineer at SheetRocks (2021-2023)
- Many other various odd jobs before that

#### Stuff & junk I like
- My wife and 2 kids
- [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev)
- LLMs, AI
- Reading & writing
- Futurama (can you spot the reference in this readme?)
- Half-Life, Counter-Strike
- Being on my computer
- Linux (currently using Mint)

#### Some snippets of my current defining concepts
- Rethink everything while respecting & building upon the past
- Determination before planning
- Thinking from my death bed
- Err on the side of honesty, so much so that it's noticeable and annoying
